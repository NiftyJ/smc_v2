THREE KINDS OF RANGE, each judged ONLY from candles that have already closed.

    from wyckoff.range_types import range_types
    r = range_types(df)            # df = your bars (M1, M5, M15 ...), one row per candle
    r = range_types(df, tf="1h")   # or build H1 candles from them first

Row t says what was known at the CLOSE of candle t. Columns (0/1 flags, plus each box):

  pause      the pause after an impulse (your picture 1)
             price spikes (a leg of IMPULSE_ATR ATRs or more in a few candles, leaving a
             fair value gap or one huge body), then goes sideways in the upper part of
             that leg. It never closes back below PAUSE_MAX_RETRACE of the leg.
             Ends when a candle closes above the pause high (the break of structure),
             or closes below that floor (the impulse failed).
             Liquidity: a low that HELD inside the spike or the pause (a pullback candle
             whose low the next PAUSE_LIQ_HOLD candles stayed above) is where stops rest.
             pause_liq is that level; pause_swept turns 1 once a pause candle trades
             below it (the takeout). The usual order is spike, pause, takeout, break.

  wyckoff    the directionless range (your picture 2)
             a band at most WY_WIDTH_K x sqrt(candles) ATRs tall that price has crossed from one
             edge to the other at least WY_CROSSINGS times, with no candle closing outside it.
             Wicks (springs, upthrusts) may poke out. Once found, the box is FROZEN and
             the flag stays on until a candle closes more than half an ATR outside it.

  staircase  the zig-zag range (your picture 3)
             structure keeps breaking to a new high, but each new high is only a small
             step (at most STAIR_STEP of the leg that made it) and price then gives back
             at least STAIR_RETRACE of that leg, back to the order block. STAIR_CYCLES
             of those in a row. Ends when a candle closes far beyond the last high
             (a real displacement), or closes below the last swing low.

  in_range   1 if any of the three is on.

pause_dir / staircase_dir: +1 = the impulse or the staircase points up, -1 = down.
pause_liq: before the takeout, the nearest resting low under the pause (NaN if there is
none yet); after it, the low that was taken. For a down pause it is a high.
Down versions are found by flipping the chart (mirror), like everywhere else in the bot.
